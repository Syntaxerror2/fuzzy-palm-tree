<br><br><h2>Here's a time line of Nelson Mandela's life:</h2><br>
<ul class="blocktext" id="tribute-info">
  <li><b>1918</B> - Born in Mvezo, South Africa</li><br>
<li><b>1933</B> - Mandela began studying law at the University of the Witwatersrand, where he was the only black African student and faced racism. There, he befriended liberal and communist European, Jewish, and Indian students, among them Joe Slovo and Ruth First.</li><br>
<li><b>1943</B> - Gaining increasing influence in the ANC, Mandela and his party cadre allies began advocating direct action against apartheid, such as boycotts and strikes, influenced by the tactics already employed by South Africa's Indian community. Having devoted his time to politics, Mandela failed his final year at Witwatersrand three times; he was ultimately denied his degree in December 1949.</li><br>
  <li><b>1955</B> - After taking part in the unsuccessful protest to prevent the forced relocation of all black people from the Sophiatown suburb of Johannesburg, Mandela concluded that violent action would prove necessary to end apartheid and white minority rule. Responding to the unrest, the government implemented state of emergency measures, declaring martial law and banning the ANC and PAC; in March, they arrested Mandela and other activists, imprisoning them for five months without charge in the unsanitary conditions of the Pretoria Local prison.</li><br>
<li><b>1964</B> - Judge Quartus de Wet soon threw out the prosecution's case for insufficient evidence, but Yutar reformulated the charges, calling 173 witnesses and bringing thousands of documents and photographs to the trial. Mandela used the trial to highlight their political cause; at the opening of the defence's proceedings, "Madiba" gave his famous three-hour "I Am Prepared to Die" speech, widely reported in the press despite official censorship. The trial gained international attention; there were global calls for the release of the accused from the United Nations and World Peace Council, while the University of London Union voted Mandela to its presidency. Justice De Wet found Mandela and two of his co-accused guilty on all four charges; although the prosecution had called for the death sentence to be applied, the judge instead condemned them to life imprisonment.</li><br>
<li><b>1990</B> - Leaving Victor Verster Prison on 11 February, Mandela held Winnie's hand in front of amassed crowds and the press; the event was broadcast live across the world. Driven to Cape Town's City Hall through crowds, he gave a speech declaring his commitment to peace and reconciliation with the white minority, but he made it clear that the ANC's armed struggle was not over and would continue as "a purely defensive action against the violence of apartheid". He expressed hope that the government would agree to negotiations, so that "there may no longer be the need for the armed struggle".</li><br>
  <li><b>1993</b> - Mandela recieves the Nobel Peace Price award.</li><br>
  <li><b>1994</B> - As widely expected, the ANC won a sweeping victory, taking 63% of the vote, just short of the two-thirds majority needed to unilaterally change the constitution. The ANC was also victorious in seven provinces, with Inkatha and the National Party each taking one. Mandela voted at the Ohlange High School in Durban, and the ANC's victory assured his election as president.</li><br>
  <li><B>1996</B> - Presiding over the transition from apartheid minority rule to a multicultural democracy, Mandela saw national reconciliation as the primary task of his presidency.</li><br>
  <li><B>2013</B> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
